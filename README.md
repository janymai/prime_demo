### Use Ruby programing language to solve

## Basic Logic

#### Please write a script or program to solve the following

**Problem 1**

The sum of the primes below 10 is `2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17`

Find the sum of all the primes below 2 million.

**Problem 2**

Which prime, below one million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?
