### Use Ruby programing language to solve

## Basic Logic

#### Please write a script or program to solve the following

**Problem 1**

The sum of the primes below 10 is `2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17`

Find the sum of all the primes below 2 million.

**Problem 2**

Which prime, below one million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

### Solve

At `prime` folder:

#### Run test case

```
rspec spec/prime_spec.rb
```

#### Check output for problem 1

**Find the sum of all the primes below 2 million**

```
ruby output/sum_of_all_primes.rb
```

**Check the time find the sum of all the primes below 2 million**

```
time ruby output/sum_of_all_primes.rb
```

#### Check output for problem 2

**Find prime, below one million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes**


```
ruby output/sum_of_most_consecutive_primes.rb
```

**Check the time find prime, below one million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes**

```
time ruby output/sum_of_most_consecutive_primes.rb
